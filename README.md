# rocket-chat

Caprover definition
We define in the captain-definition file, the docker hub image which will be used and pin it to a version.

The version itself will be manually changed for updates.
Check current version here:
https://hub.docker.com/_/rocket-chat?tab=tags

The version is set to 3.0 so the last 3.0.X will be used.
